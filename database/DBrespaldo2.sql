INSERT INTO `data` VALUES (1,'Labour chooses Manchester','The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.','The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour\'s ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move. For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference. Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn\'t want to come to the main working class resort in the country. The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.','January 23-2018',10),(2,'IAAF launches fight against drugs','The IAAF - athletics world governing body - has met anti-doping officials, coaches and athletes to co-ordinate the fight against drugs in sport.','Two task forces have been set up to examine doping and nutrition issues. It was also agreed that a programme to de-mystify the issue to athletes, the public and the media was a priority. Nothing was decided to change things - it was more to have a forum of the stakeholders allowing them to express themselves, said an IAAF spokesman. Getting everyone together gave us a lot of food for thought. About 60 people attended Sunday\'s meeting in Monaco, including IAAF chief Lamine Diack and Namibian athlete Frankie Fredericks, now a member of the Athletes\' Commission. I am very happy to see you all, members of the athletics family, respond positively to the IAAF call to sit together and discuss what more we can do in the fight against doping, said Diack. We are the leading Federation in this field and it is our duty to keep our sport clean. The two task forces will report back to the IAAF Council, at its April meeting in Qatar.','January 23-2018',11),(3,'UK Athletics agrees new kit deal','UK Athletics has agreed a new deal with adidas to supply Great Britain squads of all ages with their kit for the next four years.','The German-based firm kitted out Team GB at the 2004 Olympics and has deals with 20 other national Olympic bodies. UK Athletics chief David Moorcroft said: The Athens experience can now be extended to more major championships. In the year ahead these include the European indoor and World outdoor championships. We are delighted. Moorcroft added: It is hugely beneficial to the sport that the adidas commitment will also provide for officials and other personnel at our world-class series of live televised events. This week, UK Athletics also agreed a four-year deal with energy drink company, Red Bull, who will be supplying the product to athletics at major domestic meetings and in high performance centres.','January 23-2018',12),(4,'Famed music director Viotti dies','Conductor Marcello Viotti, director of Venices famous La Fenice Theatre, has died in Germany at 50.','Viotti, director of La Fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including Milans La Scala and the Vienna State Opera. His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet\'s Manon last week. He conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich\'s Radio Orchestra.','January 23-2018',18),(5,'Media seek Jackson juror notes','Reporters covering singer Michael Jacksons trial in California have asked to see questionnaires completed by potential jurors.','Lawyers for news organisations said it was really vital for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public to serve as a check on the process. Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (£2.13m). Meanwhile Michael Jackson\'s mother has said she is 100% certain her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the star\'s legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors\' responses made public. The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case, a motion by Mr Jackson\'s lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (£1.33m) to $4m (£2.13m) of local taxpayers\' money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (£21,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrator\'s office. Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent.','January 23-2018',19),(6,'Christmas song formula unveiled','A formula for the ultimate Christmas single has been revealed by chart bible British Hit Singles and Albums.','The recipe includes a reference to Father Christmas, sleigh bells, a children\'s choir and a charity element. The song should also include Christmas in the title, wishes for peace on earth and lots of airplay at office parties. There are common musical elements linking nearly all the big Christmas number ones of recent times, said editor David Roberts. The book\'s analysts commissioned chart prank group Moped to create the first Christmas single using the whole formula - the song is called Gonna Have a No 1 This Christmas by Moped Vs Santa. Everybody says that Christmas number ones are formulaic, but Gonna Have a Number One this Christmas is the first song to crack the formula and combine all these elements into one ultimate Christmas track said Mr Roberts. Surprisingly, there\'s no Santa listed among the 8,000, top 75 chart performers in the book, so this is our chance to help Santa to his rightful place in British recording history. Big festive hits over the years include Band Aid\'s Do They Know It\'s Christmas?, Slade\'s Merry Christmas Everybody, Wham\'s Last Christmas and Sir Cliff Richards\' Mistletoe and Wine. Band Aid 20\'s remake of Do They Know It\'s Christmas is set to be confirmed as number one in the charts on Sunday.','January 23-2018',20),(7,'Relay squad thrilled with honours','Jason Gardener says being made an MBE in the New Year Honours List underlines the achievement of Great Britain\'s 4x100m relay squad at the Olympics.','Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis have all been awarded MBEs after beating pre-race favourites USA to gold. I think this award reinforces what we did on that fantastic night, he said. This recognition is really inspiring and makes me want to have more success, said Lewis-Francis. The British sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the Americans. And when the USA stumbled with a poor switch between Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller at the 300m stage, Britain edged ahead going into the final bend. Then, on cue, Lewis-Francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off Maurice Greene to bring Team GB home in 38.07 seconds - just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals. Winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far, said the Birchfield Harrier. This award is not just for me, but for all my friends, family and the people who have helped me to get to this level in my sport. Gardener added: All of us had worked very hard for a long, long time to carry off what most believed was an impossible task. Of course this award is very special, but for me nothing will ever take away winning an Olympic gold medal. It\'s all I ever wanted. All my life that is what I dreamed of doing. Life since then has been fantastic. Campbell agreed receiving the honour capped off what has been a difficult year for the sprinter. I think the MBE is important because the people closest to me know my journey, said the Newport-based athlete. I\'ve not just stumbled upon this. It gives me a lot of joy and satisfaction to know the stuff you do for your country does mean something. There was also recognition for James Clarke, chairman of the London Marathon. He becomes an OBE.','January 23-2018',22),(8,'Cole faces lengthy injury lay-off','Aston Villa\'s Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.','The striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge, said Villa boss David O\'Leary. I won\'t be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea. Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O\'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa\'s manager\'s problems in that department.','January 23-2018',29),(9,'Mourinho expects fight to finish','Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho expects the Champions League clash with Barcelona to be a fight to the finish.','Mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last 16 in the Nou Camp. He said: I wouldn\'t be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time. I have to defend what is mine and the Champions League is mine at the moment. I\'m the last manager to have won it. Mourinho never coached Barcelona, assisting both Sir Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal. But he is not envious, insisting: I don\'t have to be jealous about Barcelona because they have 100 years of history and have won the European Cup once.','January 23-2018',27),(10,'Hearts of Oak 3-2 Cotonsport','Hearts of Oak set up an all Ghanaian Confederation Cup final with a 3-2 win over Cameroon\'s Cotonsport Garoua in Accra on Sunday.','The win for Hearts means they will play Asante Kotoko in the two-leg final, after the Kumasi team qualified from Group A on Saturday. In the other Group B game Cameroon\'s beat of South Africa 3-2 in Douala, neither side could have qualified for the final. Hearts of Oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while Cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through. Louis Agyemang scored the first two goals for Hearts either side of half time before Ben Don Bortey scored the third. Hearts looked set for a comfortable win but Cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on. First of all Boukar Makaji scored in the 89th minute and then 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the game Andre Nzame III was on target. But it was too little too late for the Cameroonians and Hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final. The first leg of the final will be played in Accra on the weekend of 27-28 November and the second leg two weeks later on the 11 December in Kumasi. In the other Group B game Cameroon\'s Sable Batie took the lead in the 35th minute through Kemadjou before Santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to Thokozani Xaba . Bernard Ngom put Sable ahead just five minutes later and then Ernest Nfor settled the game on 68 minutes. Ruben Cloete scored the South African sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock.','January 23-2018',33),(11,'More power to the people says HP','The digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to Carly Fiorina, chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard.','The job of firms such as HP now, she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. She said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. CES showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible, she told delegates. Revolution has always been about giving power to the people. She added: The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell. Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said.Ms Fiorina\'s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want.','January 23-2018',24),(12,'Big war games battle it out','The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.','The acclaimed PC title Call of Duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original\'s elements. For its part, the long-running Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun. Call of Duty: Finest Hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on World War 2 battlefronts including Russia and North Africa. It is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. On a near-identical note, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. Its arenas are the wars Pacific battles, including Guadalcanal and Pearl Harbour. You play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative US soldier.\nBoth games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. When this works, it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. When it does not, it is tedious.','January 23-2018',9),(13,'Bond game fails to shake or stir','For gaming fans, the word GoldenEye evokes excited memories not only of the James Bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left N64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.','Adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game, for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original\'s massive sense of fun. This however is not a sequel, nor does it relate to the GoldenEye film. You are the eponymous renegade spy, an agent who deserts to the Bond world\'s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds, after being deemed too brutal for MI6. Your new commander-in-chief is the portly Auric Goldfinger, last seen in 1964, but happily running around bent on world domination. With a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of Tina Turner\'s similarly-titled theme song, the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury, which enables a degree of X-ray vision.Rogue Agent signals its intentions by featuring James Bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter. The notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game, but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.Recent Bond games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair, invention and glamour of the film franchise. This title lacks that aura, and when the Bond magic shines through, it feels like a lucky accident. The central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. Quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump, the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy AI, the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. Admittedly the competition has been tough, even in recent weeks, with the likes of Halo 2 and Half Life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. What the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy, dynamic scenes of violent chaos. As is the trend of late, you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. Sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos, meaning that frustration is often the outcome. And irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is out now.','January 23-2018',30),(14,'Tories unveil quango blitz plans','Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.','Six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the Tories say would save more than £4.3bn. Among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. Tory frontbencher John Redwood said Britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.\n\nThe plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. Their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.\nAnnouncing the plans, Mr Redwood said: Mr Blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers\' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes. His party leader, Michael Howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. Labour are creating Two Britains: the Britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic Britain, he said. In the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. They\'ve seen their pensions knocked for six. They are being squeezed by extra taxes. The forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic Britain.','January 23-2018',40),(15,'Police chief backs drinking move','A chief constable has backed the introduction of 24 drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.','However, Norfolk police chief Andy Hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed. I don\'t subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it, he said. His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the government\'s plans be put on hold. Andy Hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 February. I feel that is a premature position to be taking, he said. Among those who have criticised the plans are the UK\'s top policeman Sir John Stevens.\nThe Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking epidemic. However, Mr Hayman said: It would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, I am very sorry. He said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation. My view is that I have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen,  he said. However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking. But he is confident problems in the early days can be ironed out. He believed the majority of people favoured this law change and we have to accept that lifestyles are changing. But aspects such as transport, and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account.','January 23-2018',31),(16,'Scrum-half Williams rejoins Bath','Bath have signed their former scrum-half Andy Williams on a short-term deal from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys.','Wales international Williams, whose contract with the Welsh region was due to expire in June, has agreed a contract until the end of the season. With Martyn Wood\'s injury likely to keep him out until February, Bath need experienced back-up to Nick Walshe. Said Williams: When this opportunity presented itself, I did not really have to think twice about it. Williams, capped by Wales against Romania in 2003, should figure in the match squad for Monday\'s Zurich Premiership match at Sale Sharks. He lost his Ospreys starting place to New Zealander Jason Spice and has fallen further behind in the pecking order. The Welsh region has two outstanding young No 9 prospects in Richie Rees and Rhodri Wells. Bath director of rugby Jack Rowell, though, believes Williams fits the bill perfectly. He has been playing regular Heineken Cup and Celtic League rugby and he has a great affection for Bath, Rowell told Bath\'s official website. We are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club.','January 23-2018',45),(17,'BBC poll indicates economic gloom','Citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a BBC World Service poll believe the world economy is worsening.','Most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. But when asked about their own family\'s financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster. The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill, compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. Those surveyed in three countries were split. In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving. Similarly, 48% were pessimistic about their national economy, while 41% were optimistic. And 47% saw their family\'s economic conditions improving, as against 36% who said they were getting worse. The poll of 22,953 people was conducted by the international polling firm GlobeScan, together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes (Pipa) at the University of Maryland. While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects, said Pipa director Steven Kull. People around the world are saying: I\'m OK, but the world isn\'t\'. There may be a perception that war, terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place, even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance, says the BBC\'s Elizabeth Blunt. The countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia. China has seen two decades of blistering economic growth, which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale, says the BBC\'s Louisa Lim in Beijing. But the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country\'s rosy economic future, our correspondent says.','January 23-2018',38),(18,'High fuel costs hit US airlines','Two of the largest airlines in the US - American and Southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.','American Airlines\' parent AMR reported a loss of $387m (£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m, against $66m a year earlier. Both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. American, the world\'s biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. Southwest, which has the highest market value of any US carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.\n\nAMR\'s shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. AMR\'s chief executive Gerard Arpey said the airline\'s difficulties reflected the situation within the industry. AMR\'s results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment, he said. For the full year, AMR posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003\'s $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. AMR added that as part of its cost cutting measures, it is postponing the delivery of 54 Boeing jets. Shares in Southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment. The results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter, said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities. Both American and Southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the US airline industry, as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions.','January 23-2018',70),(19,'How to make a greener computer','The hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware. Bill Thompson thinks it\'s about time.','My first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as I drove around Cambridge. Now you can\'t buy petrol with lead additives, and we\'re all better off as a result. Chip giant Intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too, reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.\nApart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic, mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves, the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up, with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. And work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient, since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops, mobiles and music players.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. If you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. A well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. This is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in Europe since from August the new Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.\n\nThey will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit, something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. It is, as they say, about time. We have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment, and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. The car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder, a phenomenon called \'knocking\', so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. Redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work, so it took decades before it was done. We\'re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and, as a result, there are billions of devices, from old mobile phones to antique handhelds, that will have to be recycled in years to come. If Apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new Mac Mini and throwing away their old PC, keeping the monitor and other peripherals.\n\nEven if Apple does not get its way, four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it\'s not unreasonable to replace them. But what do we do with the old ones?\n\nI\'ve just looked around my office and I find two monitors, an old 386 PC, two old handhelds, three ancient laptops, four antique mobile phones, a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a Sun workstation that is no longer really much use. They are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it\'s possible that some of the components could be useful. I could take them up the to the council recycling centre, but it\'s a 10-mile drive away across town, and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. Here in Cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste, a box for glass, cans and paper that can be recycled, and a black bin for the rest. There are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. Would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too? I\'d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually.\n\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.','January 23-2018',80),(20,'Sayeed to stand down as Tory MP','Tory MP Jonathan Sayeed is to stand down on the grounds of ill health.','The decision comes after Mr Sayeed survived an attempt to deselect him in a row over allegations he had profited from private tours of Parliament. The Mid-Bedfordshire MP had denied a claim that he was paid for guiding visitors around the Palace of Westminster. Conservative leader Michael Howard has now accepted the MP\'s resignation, it has been announced.\n\nMr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen well below the standards expected. The Conservative Party had already been withdrawn the whip for a month. But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him, with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes. After the vote, Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election. But the vote prompted constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell to resign in protest. The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed. Mr Sayeed had denied the claims, saying the suspension was unjust and wrong but he made an unreserved apology to MPs in the Commons chamber. He insisted that the committee\'s report had contained a few errors of fact. Mr Sayeed has been MP for Mid-Bedfordshire since 1997.
